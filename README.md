### Purpose
Created to follow the [Hello World GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). Bling added to keep things exciting since I've been around the GitHub block a few times.

### Stuff I Learned

- [x] Start and manage a new branch
- [x] Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
- [x] Open and merge a pull request
