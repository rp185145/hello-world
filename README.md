### About Me

I create [hello world projects](https://github.com/search?q=hello+world) for fun, fame, and fortune.

### Purpose
Created to follow the [Hello World GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). Bling added to keep things exciting since I've been around the GitHub block a few times.
